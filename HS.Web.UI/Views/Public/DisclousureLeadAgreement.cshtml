                    From time to time, @Model.CompanyName and/or one of its authorized dealers (collectively referred to as,
                    "we", "us" or "Company") may be required by law to provide to you certain written notices or
                    disclosures. Described below are the terms and conditions for providing to you such notices and
                    disclosures electronically through your email address provided herein or your DocuSign, Inc.

                <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    At any time, you may request from us a paper copy of any record provided or made available
                    electronically to you by us. For such copies, as long as you are an authorized user of the
                    DocuSign system you will have the ability to download and print any documents we send to you
                    through your DocuSign user account for a limited period of time (usually 30 days) after such
                    documents are first sent to you. After such time, if you wish for us to send you paper copies of
                    any such documents from our office to you, you will be charged a per-page fee. You may
                    request delivery of such paper copies from us by following the procedure described below. You
                    may also request paper copies by sending notice electronically to info@rmrcloud.com
                    or in writing to P.O. Box 814530, Dallas, Texas 75381-4530 and in the body of such request you
                    must state your e-mail address, full name, US Postal address, and telephone number.

                <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    If you decide to receive notices and disclosures from us electronically, you may at any time
                    change your mind and tell us that thereafter you want to receive required notices and disclosures
                    only in paper format. How you must inform us of your decision to receive future notices and
                    disclosure in paper format and withdraw your consent to receive notices and disclosures
                    electronically is described below.

                <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    If you elect to receive required notices and disclosures only in paper format, it will slow the
                    speed at which we can complete certain steps in transactions with you and delivering services to
                    you because we will need first to send the required notices or disclosures to you in paper format,
                    and then wait until we receive back from you your acknowledgment of your receipt of such
                    paper notices or disclosures. To indicate to us that you are changing your mind, you may
                    withdraw your consent by sending notice electronically to info@rmrcloud.com or in
                    writing to P.O. Box 814530, Dallas, Texas 75381-4530. This will indicate to us that you have
                    withdrawn your consent to receive required notices and disclosures electronically from us and
                    you will no longer be able to use your email or your DocuSign Express user account to receive
                    required notices and consents electronically from us or to sign electronically documents from us.

                <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    Unless you tell us otherwise in accordance with the procedures described herein, we will provide
                    electronically to you through your email address and/or your DocuSign user account all required
                    notices, disclosures, authorizations, acknowledgements, and other documents that are required to
                    be provided or made available to you during the course of our relationship with you. To reduce
                    the chance of you inadvertently not receiving any notice or disclosure, we prefer to provide all of
                    the required notices and disclosures to you by the same method and to the same address that you
                    have given us. Thus, you may receive the disclosures and notices electronically or in paper
