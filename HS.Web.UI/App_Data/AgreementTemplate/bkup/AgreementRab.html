            Upon receipt of a non-verified alarm signal, Company will attempt to contact the Customer and/or the persons submitted to Company on Customer’s
            contact list to verify whether an emergency exists. Methods of verification used by Company include verbal verification or receipt of a cancel or false signal from the alarm
            system. In necessary situations, Company will attempt to contact the appropriate responding agency or a guard service. Company and Customer must comply with local
            notification and response requirements, which may now or in the future include visual verification of an emergency condition prior to response. Customer agrees to pay
            any charge associated with this requirement, including any fees for guard or police services. For non-emergency signals such as low battery, communication failure,
            sensor troubles and a/c power fails, Company may, in its sole discretion, decline to notify the Customer. It is the Customer ‘s responsibility to test the functionality of all
            components of his/her System each month.

                    </b>
                    Customer’s System communicates with the Company’s monitoring facility utilizing one or more networks - telephone, cable, Internet, cellular, or
                    radio. It may also utilize equipment in Customer‘s home - telephone or cable equipment,
                    modem, router, power supply. Together, the System, the network and other equipment
                    represent the “Transmission System”. This Transmission System is beyond the control of
                    Company and Company takes no responsibility for its reliability or its continued compatibility
                    with this intended usage. Each network and the related in-home equipment has its own
                    inherent risks and reliability levels and the Customer should consider their own needs and
                    requirements before choosing a Transmission System.
                    <b>
                        In order for the system to transmit signals over the internet, it must have uninterrupted access to an always-on highspeed
                        internet connection.
                    </b>
                    If a signal from Customer’s System does not reach Company’s monitoring facility for any reason, Company will not be able to respond. Communication
                    issues might include, but are not limited to, network outages, severed lines, lack of power to
                    key components, signal jamming, obsolescence or failure of components, and/or changes
                    in laws or regulations.
                    <b>
                        Company is not responsible for notifying Customer of such communication issues.
                    </b>
                    The Customer should test the System on a regular monthly basis and any time there is a change to any aspect of the Transmission System (See Section 6).
                    The Customer should immediately notify the Company of any changes to the Transmission
                    System (including use of DSL, VoIP or other broadband services as these may interfere with
                    or prevent signal transmission) or any communication issues identifed by Customer during
                    testing.
                    <b>
                        IF THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM USES A TELEPHONE LINE AND THAT LINE
                        IS DISCONNECTED, THE ALARM TRANSMISSION WILL FAIL.
                    </b>
                    If Customer has chosen
                    a means of communication that causes the System to seize control of a communication
                    network in order to communicate with the monitoring facility, Customer understands that they
                    will not be able to use that same communication network to call for emergency response
                    during the time that the communication network is in use. Customer’s panel may be
                    preprogrammed.

                    Premises or Company’s or its contractor’s monitoring facilities become so substantially

                    The parties agree that arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial rules of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Arbitration or any related litigation
                    will take place in the county where this Agreement was made, unless both parties agree to a different location. The arbitration shall be conducted by an attorney who is knowledgeable
                    about the security industry. The arbitrator is not authorized to grant punitive damages.
                    Customer and Company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in
                    Customer or Company’s individual capacity, and not as a Plaintiff or class member in any
                    purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both Customer and Company
                    agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may
                    not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding of which these claims will
                    be a part. All direct and indirect costs for arbitration will be paid by the non-prevailing party or
                    split in an equitable manner by the arbitrator. The arbitration proceedings, including decisions
                    and awards, shall be held in confdence by both parties. The parties acknowledge that by
                    executing this Agreement, they are waiving all rights to a jury or bench trial for all claims
                    between the parties.
