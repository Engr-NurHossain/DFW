If ONIT Smart Home’s records indicate that Customer is past due or in default, ONIT Smart Home is authorized to seek collection of the past due account.  Customer agrees to waive the applicable provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by allowing and requesting ONIT Smart Home to contact Customer for the purpose of collecting a debt.  ONIT Smart Home may transfer any past due account to an independent third party collection agency for the purpose of collecting a debt.  Customer will be responsible for paying the remaining applicable balance owed under the Agreement along with fees imposed by either ONIT Smart Home or the independent third party collection agency related to the past due or defaulted balance.

                Equipment is the property of the Customer subject to the terms of this Agreement.  The Equipment will be installed to the address submitted by an authorized agent of ONIT Smart Home.

                <br /> <br />
                <b> Monitoring Communication. </b> The Equipment includes a communicator that sends signals to the Monitoring Facility over Customer’s telephone line, broadband service, or cellular network, as applicable.  Customer acknowledges that signals are transmitted over the telephone line, broadband, or cellular service provider’s networks and are beyond the control of ONIT Smart Home and the Monitoring Facility.  Customer acknowledges that if the telephone line, broadband service, or cellular network service is disconnected in any manner whatsoever, or not working for any reason, alarm signals cannot be transmitted to the Monitoring Facility.  If the telephone, broadband, or cellular service is out of order, placed on vacation status or otherwise not working, signals cannot be transmitted and ONIT Smart Home will not know of the telephone, broadband, or cellular service problem.  Customer agrees to reimburse ONIT Smart Home for any cost incurred by ONIT Smart Home to reprogram the communications device of the Equipment because of area code changes, other dialing pattern changes or other communication access changes.

                Customer will pay for all telephone or broadband service charges including any installation fee for any special jack or other device to connect the system to Customer’s telephone or broadband service.

If the service is discontinued or Customer moves, it becomes the responsibility of Customer to call ONIT Smart Home so the communicator may be disabled from sending signals.
                <br /> <br />
                <span style="display:block; width:75px; text-align:center; float:left;">1.17</span>
                TAMPERING WITH OR DISTRUPTION OF TELEPHONE OR BROADBAND SERVICE OR CUTTING OF TELEPHONE LINE OR BROADBAND SERVICE LINE WILL PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SIGNAL.  CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT MAY BE AVAILABLE AT AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO MONITOR THIS CONDITION OR PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION CHANNEL AS A BACKUP.
                <br /> <br />
                <span style="display:block; width:75px; text-align:center; float:left;">1.18</span>
                The use of DSL, VoIP or other broadband telephone service may prevent the system from transmitting alarm signals to the Monitoring Facility at time of Equipment installation or any time in the future.  It is the responsibility of Customer to have their telephone service provider to install the necessary transmission filters to allow transmission of alarms signals.  Customer agrees to notify ONIT Smart Home if DSL, VoIP or other broadband telephone service has been installed or if Customer intends to install DSL, VoIP or other broadband telephone service.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INSTALLATION OF ANY BROADBAND TELEPHONE SERVICE CUSTOMER MUST TEST THE SYSTEM’S SIGNAL TRANSMISSION AND NOTIFY THE ONIT SMART HOME CENTER AT 800-610-2145.  Additionally, ONIT Smart Home recommends Customer install and maintain appropriate battery backup to the broadband service router, switch and modem providing Internet access to help ensure uninterrupted communication access in case of power loss to Customer premises.  It is the sole responsibility of the Customer to provide adequate power back-up to the DSL, VoIP, or broadband communication equipment when used with the security system Equipment to help ensure uninterrupted communication access in case of power loss to Customer’s premises.  Customer acknowledges that failure to provide adequate power back-up during a power outage will disable communications to the monitoring station and alarm signals will not be sent and as a result, Customer’s Emergency Contacts will not be notified.  The Equipment cannot transmit signals to the Monitoring Facility via Customer’s cellular phone service.  Customer understands that additional equipment may be available, at an additional cost and additional monthly fee that may transmit signals.
                <br /> <br />
                Customer agrees that Customer negotiated and executed this Agreement solely by the means of facsimile, mail, E-Mail, telephone and/or Internet communications.

ONIT Smart Home will store a maximum of four hundred (400) recorded video events unless the Customer has subscribed for additional storage as set forth on the list of optional services in the definition of Video System above.  Once the Customer‘s maximum storage amount is exceeded, the oldest stored video will be replaced by the newest video and any replaced video will no longer be available for viewing or any other purpose.  The videos generated and transmitted by the Video System will be deleted from the server upon or following termination of this Addendum.  If the Customer wishes to save any of such videos, the Customer will need to utilize the Customer’s own equipment and download the videos during the term of this Addendum.

The Customer may choose to share its log-in information with other persons, or the Customer may add additional users of the account by issuing them a username and password.

                The major threat from fire in a family living unit is at night when everyone is asleep.  The principal threat to persons in sleeping areas comes from fires in the reminder of the unit.  Therefore, smoke alarm(s) should be located outside each sleeping area(s) on each level/floor.

                ONIT Smart Home follows the recommendations contained in the U.S. National Fire Protection Association’s (NFPA) Standard #72 for the number and placement of smoke and heat detectors stated below:

                    <li>
                        Install a smoke detector inside every bedroom.  A smoke alarm in the hallway outside the sleeping area may not wake up the sleeper if the door is closed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Smoke detectors shall be installed outside of each separate sleeping area, in the immediate vicinity of the sleeping rooms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Install a smoke detector at both ends of a hallway if the hallway is more than forty (40) feet (12 meters) long.

                The selection and location of the minimum required smoke alarms does not provide adequate protection for the occupants from a fire starting in their bedrooms, nor do the required smoke alarms provide reliable early warning protection for those areas separated by a door from the areas protected by the required smoke alarms.  For these reasons, it is recommended that the householder consider the use of additional smoke detectors for those areas for increased detection.  The additional areas include: finished basement, dining room, and hallways not protected by the required smoke alarms.  The installation of smoke detectors or alarms in kitchens, attics (finished or unfinished), or in garages is prohibited as these locations occasionally experience conditions which may result in improper operation and produce multiple false alarms.  The installation of heat detectors and smoke detectors or alarms in detached buildings is prohibited.

                Since an emergency is always unexpected, you should develop plans to help prepare for a variety of emergency situations.  Periodically discuss and rehearse emergency plans with your family to include the following:


                <ul>
                    <li>Understand how to use your security system.</li>

                    <li>Know the normal state of doors and windows: open, closed, or locked.</li>

                    <li>Escape fast!  Do not stop to pack.</li>

                    <li> Use a different escape route if closed doors feel hot to the touch.</li>

                    <li>Crawl and hold your breath as much as possible to help reduce smoke inhalation during your escape.</li>

                    <li>Meet at a designated outdoor location.  Emphasize that no one should return to the premises if there is a fire.</li>
