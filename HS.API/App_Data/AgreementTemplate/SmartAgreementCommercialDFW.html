                        I authorize Company to withdraw the amounts in this section from my bank account or credit card through an Automated Clearing House (ACH).  These payments are for the equipment and services described in this Contract.  This authorization will remain in effect for the duration of this Contract or until I cancel it in writing. I also agree to notify Company in writing of any changes to my account information at least 15 days prior to the next billing date.  If a payment falls on a weekend or holiday, payment may be executed on the next business day.  Because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may be withdrawn from my account each month as early as the transaction date.  If an ACH transaction is rejected for non-sufficient funds (NFS), Company may attempt to process the charge again within 30 days and an NFS charge may apply.  The origination of ACH transactions to my account must comply with provisions of U.S. law.  I am an authorized user of this credit card or bank account and I will not dispute the payment with my credit card company or bank so long as the amount corresponds to the terms indicated in this Contract.

                You will permit us to install the system during our normal business hours. You have approved the locations where the control panel, audible devices and all protective devices will be installed. We will try to conceal all wires, but limited attic or crawl spaces or other construction problems may require that some wire be exposed.  If the system includes an exterior audible bell, horn or siren, it is designed to shut off after sounding for not more than fifteen minutes.  You will provide electrical outlets for the system`s transformers and any other devices requiring electrical power.  We are not responsible if the installation is delayed because of the condition of the premises, bad weather, labor disputes or other reasons beyond our control.  After we complete the system, you and our representative will inspect it.  If something is missing or not properly installed you will notify the company within ten (10) days, otherwise the system will have been accepted by you.

                <b style="text-decoration:underline;">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: </b>
                A. INSURANCE; WAIVER OF SUBROGATION.  I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT COMPANY IS NOT AN INSURER AND THAT COMPANY IS NOT PROVIDING ME WITH INSURANCE OF ANY TYPE.  I FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE AMOUNTS I PAY COMPANY ARE NOT INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND ARE NOT RELATED TO THE VALUE OF MY PROPERTY, ANYONE ELSE`S PROPERTY LOCATED ON MY PREMISES, OR ANY RISK OF LOSS AT MY PREMISES. INSTEAD, THE AMOUNTS COMPANY CHARGES ME ARE BASED SOLELY UPON THE VALUE OF THE EQUIPMENT INSTALLED BY COMPANY AND SERVICES COMPANY PROVIDES AND UPON THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY ASSUMES UNDER THIS CONTRACT. IF I WANT INSURANCE TO PROTECT AGAINST ANY RISK OF LOSS AT MY PREMISES, I WILL PURCHASE IT FROM AN INSURANCE PROVIDER. IN THE EVENT OF ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY, I AGREE TO LOOK EXCLUSIVELY TO MY INSURER AND NOT TO COMPANY TO COMPENSATE ME OR ANYONE ELSE REGARDLESS OF THE CONDUCT OF COMPANY. I RELEASE AND WAIVE FOR MYSELF ANY INSURER ALL SUBROGATION AND OTHER RIGHTS TO RECOVER AGAINST COMPANY ARISING AS A RESULT OF THE PAYMENT OF ANY CLAIM FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY.
                B. NO GUARANTEE, NO LIABILITY.  I HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT COMPANY`S EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES DO NOT CAUSE AND CANNOT ELIMINATE OCCURRENCES OF THE EVENTS THEY ARE INTENDED TO DETECT OR AVERT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FIRES, FLOODS, BURGLARIES, ROBBERIES, AND MEDICAL PROBLEMS.  I UNDERSTAND THAT OTHER THAN THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN PARAGRAPH 4. AND/OR EXTENDED SERVICE PLAN SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 4.2 (WHICH OBLIGATES COMPANY ONLY TO REPAIR EQUIPMENT AND DOES NOT IMPACT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY), COMPANY MAKES NO GUARANTY OR WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, THAT THE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES PROVIDED WILL DETECT OR AVERT SUCH INCIDENTS OR THEIR CONSEQUENCES. FURTHER, I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT COMPANY DOES NOT UNDERTAKE ANY RISK THAT I OR MY PROPERTY, OR THE PERSON OR PROPERTY OF OTHERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO INJURY OR LOSS IF SUCH AN EVENT OCCURS. FURTHER, I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ALLOCATION OF SUCH RISK REMAINS WITH ME AND NOT WITH COMPANY.  FOR THESE REASONS, I HEREBY RELEASE, WAIVE, DISCHARGE AND PROMISE NOT TO SUE OR BRING ANY CLAIM OF ANY TYPE AGAINST COMPANY FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY RELATING TO THE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY COMPANY REGARDLESS OF THE CLAIM OR CAUSE.
                C. EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. IT IS IMPRACTICAL AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ACTUAL DAMAGES, IF ANY, THAT MAY RESULT FROM A FAILURE BY COMPANY TO PERFORM ANY OF ITS OBLIGATIONS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL I ATTEMPT TO HOLD COMPANY LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR DAMAGES TO PROPERTY. IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, COMPANY IS FOUND LIABLE FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY DUE TO A FAILURE OF THE SERVICES AND/OR EQUIPMENT PROVIDED BY COMPANY, COMPANY`S LIABILITY TO ME SHALL BE LIMITED TO A SUM EQUAL TO $250.00. I ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS AGREED-UPON AMOUNT IS NOT A PENALTY; RATHER, IT IS MY SOLE REMEDY UPON MY REQUEST.  COMPANY MAY AGREE TO ASSUME LIABILITY BEYOND WHAT IS PROVIDED FOR IN PARAGRAPH 10.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY BY ATTACHING A SIGNED AMENDMENT TO THIS CONTRACT SETTING FORTH THE EXTENT OF COMPANY`S LIABILITY AND THE ADDITIONAL CHARGES TO ME.
                D. APPLICATION. THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLY NO MATTER HOW THE LOSS, DAMAGE, INJURY OR OTHER CONSEQUENCE OCCURS, EVEN IF DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE BY COMPANY OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS CONTRACT OR FROM NEGLIGENCE (ACTIVE OR OTHERWISE), STRICT LIABILITY VIOLATION OF ANY APPLICABLE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY OR ALLEGED FAULT ON THE PART OF COMPANY.
                E. INDEMNITY. IF ANY OTHER PERSON, INCLUDING MY SUBROGATING INSURER, MAKES ANY CLAIM OR FILES ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST COMPANY IN ANYWAY RELATED TO THE EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY COMPANY TO ME, I AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD COMPANY HARMLESS FROM ANY AND ALL SUCH CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS, INCLUDING THE PAYMENT OF ALL DAMAGES, EXPENSES, COSTS AND ATTORNEY FEES.  MY DUTY TO DEFEND IS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM MY DUTY TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS AND ARISES UPON THE ASSERTION OF A CLAIM OR DEMAND AGAINST COMPANY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER COMPANY HAS BEEN FOUND LIABLE OR WHETHER COMPANY HAS INCURRED ANY EXPENSE.

I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT OTHER POTENTIAL CAUSES OF SUCH A FAILURE OVER CERTAIN TELEPHONE SERVICES INCLUDE THE LOSS OF NORMAL ELECTRICAL POWER TO MY PREMISES (THE BATTERY BACK-UP FOR MY ALARM PANEL DOES NOT POWER MY TELEPHONE SERVICE) AND ELECTRONICS FAILURES SUCH AS CELLULAR COMMUNICATOR MALFUNCTION. TRANSMISSION OF FIRE ALARM SIGNALS BY MEANS OF OTHER THAN A TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE LINE MAY NOT BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE FIRE ALARM OR OTHER STANDARDS OR CODES AND IT IS SOLELY MY OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH SUCH STANDARDS AND CODES. MY ALARM PANEL MAY BE UNABLE TO SEIZE MY TELEPHONE LINE TO TRANSMIT AN ALARM SIGNAL IF ANOTHER CONNECTION IS OFF THE HOOK DUE TO IMPROPER CONNECTION OR OTHERWISE. COMPANY RECOMMENDS THAT I TEST MY EQUIPMENT MONTHLY, EVEN THOUGH A SUCCESSFUL TEST OF MY EQUIPMENT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT COMPANY WILL RECEIVE ALARM SIGNALS FROM MY EQUIPMENT IN THE FUTURE.
