                    <b> MONITORING SERVICES PROVIDED:</b>
                    Upon receipt of a fire alarm signal from Subscriber’s fire alarm system, DFW or its designee Monitoring Center shall make every reasonable effort to notify Subscriber and the appropriate municipal fire department and comply with AHJ dispatch procedures.  Only Subscriber will be notified of fire trouble, fire supervisory or other off normal signals as soon as may be practical.  Subscriber acknowledges that signals transmitted from Subscriber's premises directly to fire departments are not monitored by personnel of DFW or its Monitoring Center and DFW does not assume any responsibility for the manner in which such signals are monitored or the response, if any, to such signals.  Subscriber acknowledges that signals which are transmitted over telephone lines, wire, air waves, internet, Managed Facilities Voice Networks, VOIP, or other modes of communication pass through communication networks wholly beyond the control of DFW and are not maintained by DFW except DFW may own the radio network and  DFW shall not be responsible for any failure which prevents transmission signals or data from reaching the Monitoring Center or damages arising  therefrom, or for data corruption, theft or viruses to Subscriber’s computers if connected to the communication equipment.  The fire alarm system and communication pathway may not function during a power failure or not maintain functionality for a 24 hour period as required by NFPA-72 for fire alarm systems and Subscriber is responsible for verifying operation of the communication pathway with the communications pathway provider.  Subscriber agrees to furnish DFW with a written Call List of names and telephone numbers of persons Subscriber wishes to receive notification of fire alarm signals.  Unless otherwise provided in the Call List DFW will make a reasonable effort to contact the first person reached or notified on the list either via telephone call, text or email message.  No more than one call to the list shall be required and any form of notification provided for herein, including leaving a message on an answering machine, shall be deemed reasonable compliance with DFW’s notification obligation.  All changes and revisions to the account information shall be supplied to DFW in writing.  Subscriber authorizes DFW to access the control panel and/or communicator to input or delete data and programming.  If Subscriber requests DFW to reprogram system functions remotely, Subscriber shall pay DFW $120.00 for each such service, and any change in programming requires a full physical test of all fire alarm components pursuant to NFPA 72 and AHJ requirements which testing shall be at Subscriber’s expense at DFW’s customary charges.  DFW may, without prior notice, suspend or terminate its services in event of Subscriber’s default in performance of this agreement or in event Monitoring Center’s facility or communication network is nonoperational or Subscriber’s system is sending excessive false alarms. Monitoring Center is authorized to record and maintain all data, voice and alarm communications and shall be the exclusive owner of such property.  If AHJ requires a technician to be sent to Subscriber’s premises after a fire alarm is dispatched, or if Runner service exceeds maximum Runs per year, Subscriber agrees to pay $225.00 per call.

                    In the event that any part of the equipment you purchase from DFW and is installed by DFW becomes defective, DFW agrees to make all repairs and replacement of parts without costs to the Subscriber for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of installation.  DFW reserves the option to either replace or repair the equipment, and reserves the right to substitute materials of equal quality at time of replacement, or to use reconditioned parts in fulfillment of this warranty.  DFW’s warranty does not include damage caused by electric, plumbing or construction, nor damage by lightning, electrical surge, or misuse.  DFW is not the manufacturer of the equipment and other than DFW’s limited warranty Subscriber agrees to look exclusively to the manufacturer of the equipment for repairs under its warranty coverage if any.

                        Except as set forth in this agreement, DFW makes no express warranties as to any matter whatsoever, including but not limited to, unless prohibited by law, the condition of the equipment, its merchantability, or its fitness for any particular purpose, and DFW shall not be liable for consequential damages.  DFW does not represent nor warrant that the  equipment may not be compromised or circumvented, or that the system will prevent any loss by fire, smoke or water or otherwise;  or that the system will in all cases provide the protection for which it is installed.  DFW expressly disclaims any implied warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
                    </b>
                    The warranty does not cover any damage to material or equipment caused by accident, misuse, attempted or unauthorized repair service, modification, or improper installation by anyone other than DFW.  DFW shall not be liable for consequential damages.  Subscriber acknowledges that any affirmation of fact or promise made by DFW shall not be deemed to create an express warranty unless included in this agreement in writing;  that Subscriber is not relying on DFW’s skill or judgment in selecting or furnishing a system suitable for any particular purpose and that there are no warranties which extend beyond those on the face of this agreement, and that DFW has offered additional and more sophisticated equipment for an additional charge which Subscriber has declined. Subscriber's exclusive remedy for DFW’s breach of this agreement or negligence to any degree under this agreement is to require DFW to repair or replace, at DFW’s option, any equipment which is non-operational. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of consequential or incidental damages, or a limitation on the duration of implied warranties, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.  The warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other rights which may vary from state to state.  Fire Alarms are required to be approved by AHJ and may require plans and specifications designed, signed and submitted by a licensed architect or professional engineer, which must be engaged by Subscriber.  If DFW is installing a Fire Alarm System to code installation must be approved by the AHJ.  This Limited Warranty is independent of and in addition to repair service contracted under paragraph 2b of this agreement.

                    DFW shall not be liable for any damage or loss sustained by Subscriber as a result of delay in delivery and/or installation of equipment, equipment failure, or for interruption of service due to electric failure, strikes, walk-outs, war, acts of God, or other causes, including DFW's negligence or failure to perform any obligation.  The estimated date work is to be substantially completed is not a definite completion date and time is not of the essence. In the event the work is delayed through no fault of DFW, DFW shall have such additional time for performance as may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances.  Subscriber agrees to pay DFW the sum of $1,000 per day for each business day the work is re-scheduled or delayed by Subscriber or others engaged by Subscriber through no fault of DFW on less than 24 hour notice to DFW.  If installation is delayed for more than one year from date hereof through no fault of DFW, Subscriber agrees to pay an additional 5% of the contract Purchase Price upon installation.  Subscriber assumes all risk of loss of material once delivered to the job site.  DFW is authorized to make preparations such as drilling holes, driving nails, making attachments or doing any other thing necessary in DFW’s sole discretion for the installation and service of the  equipment, and DFW shall not be responsible for any condition created thereby as a result of such installation, service, or removal of the equipment, and Subscriber represents that the owner of the premises, if other than Subscriber, authorizes the installation of the equipment under the terms of this agreement.

DFW shall have no liability for permit fees, false alarms, false alarm fines, fire response, any damage to personal or real property or personal injury caused by fire department response to alarm, whether false alarm or otherwise,  or the refusal of the fire department to respond.  In the event of termination of fire response by the fire department this agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and Subscriber shall remain liable for all payments provided for herein.  Should DFW be required by existing or hereafter enacted law to perform any service or furnish any material not specifically covered by the terms of this agreement Subscriber agrees to pay DFW for such service or material. Subscriber agrees that it will not solicit for employment for itself, or any other entity, or employ, in any capacity any employee of DFW assigned by DFW to perform any service for or on behalf of Subscriber for a period of two years after DFW has completed providing service to Subscriber. In the event of Subscriber’s violation of this provision, in addition to injunctive relief, DFW shall recover from Subscriber an amount equal to such employee's salary based upon the average three months preceding employee's termination of employment with DFW, times twelve, together with DFW’s counsel and expert witness fees. Subscriber is responsible for engaging licensed trades to perform any work which DFW is not licensed to perform interconnecting the fire alarm to HVAC, elevators, appliances and other electronic and mechanical systems. It is Subscriber's responsibility to obtain a Certificate of Occupancy for the intended use of the premises affected by the fire alarm or obtain a Letter of No Objection from the AHJ if a Certificate of Occupancy is not available. It is Subscriber's sole responsibility to cure any building or Environmental Control Board violations. In the event Subscriber or any third party subpoenas or summons DFW requiring any services or appearances, Subscriber agrees to pay DFW $150 per hour for such services and appearances.  Subscriber shall reimburse DFW for any Monitoring Center charges for excessive signals.

The fire alarm and DFW’s services are designed to detect and reduce certain risks of loss, though DFW does not guarantee that no loss or damage will occur.

The parties intend that the Subscriber assume all potential risk and damage that may arise by reason of failure of the equipment or DFW's services and that Subscriber will look to its own insurance carrier for any loss or assume the risk of loss.  DFW shall not be responsible for any portion of any loss or damage which is recovered or recoverable by Subscriber from insurance covering such loss or damage or for such loss or damage against which Subscriber is indemnified or insured.
