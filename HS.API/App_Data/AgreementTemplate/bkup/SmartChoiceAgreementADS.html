                        I authorize Company to withdraw the amounts in this section from my bank account or credit card through an Automated Clearing House (ACH). These payments are for the equipment and services described in this Contract. This authorization will remain in effect for the duration of this Contract or until I cancel it in writing. I also agree to notify Company in writing of any changes to my account information at least 15 days prior to the next billing date. If a payment falls on a weekend or holiday, payment may be executed on the next business day. Because this is an electronic transaction, these funds may be withdrawn from my account each month as early as the transaction date. If an ACH transaction is rejected for non-sufficient funds (NFS), Company may attempt to process the charge again within 30 days and an NFS charge may apply. The origination of ACH transactions to my account must comply with provisions of U.S. law. I am an authorized user of this credit card or bank account and I will not dispute the payment with my credit card company or bank so long as the amount corresponds to the terms indicated in this Contract.

You will provide electrical outlets for the system's transformers and any other devices requiring electrical power. We are not responsible if the installation is delayed because of the condition of the premises, bad weather, labor disputes or other reasons beyond our control. After we complete the system, you and our representative will inspect it. If something is missing or not properly installed you will notify the company within ten (10) days, otherwise the system will have been accepted by you.
